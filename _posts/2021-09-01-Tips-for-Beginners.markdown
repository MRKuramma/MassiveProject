Buying a Metal Detector is just the first step in a persons’ quest to look for old artifacts, jewelry, coins, etc. Before going on that expedition, here are a few tips worth knowing that will help make the search, a successful one. 

If you read my article about “**Introduction to Metal Detecting**”, then, surely you already know that, most Metal Detectors should have three main components.
Which are: **Control Box**, **Search Coil**, and the **Shaft**. (I won’t expand on what any of these parts do, since I had already done it, in the beginners guide.)
Therefore, if you’re thinking of buying a Metal Detector, you should think of buying one, that includes all 3 main parts.

1. People who don’t know how to use a Metal Detector, should learn from those who know how to use it, check for online videos, or mess around with it for a bit, before going on a real expedition.
This will make it easier for the person to know when there is something worth digging or just ignoring and continue on with the search.

2. Before going out, the Metal Detector should always be checked to make sure it is functioning properly, batteries fully charged, or having any bad parts. The best way would be to take a coin and hide it somewhere in your house, outside, garage or anywhere else, and have the individual successfully find it; this will crucially increase the chances of finding other artifacts during the treasure hunt.

3. Another thing that has to be checked is the weather. Studies about Metal Detecting have shown that looking for objects when it is snowing or raining outside is useless because these interfere with the instruments on the Metal Detector. This means, that the person will have to wait until the conditions outside improve or reschedule the search for a sunny day with better conditions. 

4. Dressing in proper clothes, is very important during a treasure hunt, and should be adjusted to the weather conditions outside. A proper outfit can keep the individual warm on cold days, or cool on sunny and dehydrating days.
They can also help the individual feel free from insect bites.
5. Most treasure hunts, take hours before anything is found. It would be a good idea to take a tent for the person to rest in, some water and food would also be
great along the way. Because of dehydration and starvation, often causes those in the group to call off the search, and continue it another day.

6. Metal Detectors run on batteries. Since these will wear out in a few hours, it would be a good idea to carry spare ones, so the person can continue to look for treasures.

7. The treasure hunter should research the designated area before going in. This will save the individual time and energy, which can be put to better use looking in the right place.

8. Taking too many things with you, can be more hindering and tiring than useful.
Consider, taking only useful things with you, such as spare batteries, water, food, and a tent (only if you’re not planning on returning home after a few hours, and prefers to sleep outside, and continue the search the day after).

9. When buying a Metal Detector, you should always research on parts and materials of the one you want to buy. Try to get a cheap and good one.
Saving money is also good. Cause, if something happens to your Metal Detector, it will be bad, if you’ve wasted a lot of money on it.

10. Before buying a Metal Detector, you should check if it has 30 days money-back guarantee. If you do buy one with money-back guarantee, and something happens to your detector, then you will be able to replace it for a new one, or just get your money back, and search for a new one.

11. Determine first where you are going to use your metal detector.
You need to determine the locations which you will frequent with your metal detector since there are features that work only for certain locations; while some features won’t work for other locations. Will you be using it in the woods, on the beach, or in your backyard?

12. Budget constraints.
Are you truly in love with this hobby? If you’re not yet sure if you would enjoy this activity, it would be best not to splurge on the high-end types of metal detectors just yet. Going for something basic will do in the mean time. As you advance or start to get the hang of the activity and decide to do it for the long haul, then, you might want to invest on a pricier and more advanced type of metal detector.

13. Will you use it so often or not?
The battery life of your choice metal detector model must be a consideration. If you are not going to be engaging in the activity for long hours almost everyday, a long battery life span might not be advantageous for you. Choose a model that will not die on you just when you needed it most.

14. Newbie or geek? That is the question.
If you are a beginner, you might simply be better off acquiring the basic one for the present time. If you’ve been into metal detecting for quite a long time now, naturally, it would be wise to get one of the more high-tech types. Do your homework and know about the latest metal detecting technologies.

Other concerns that a wise Metal Detector buyer must not overlook, is to include the accuracy of the detector, its durability and if it can be upgraded. Those depend on your experience and preferences, of course. 

One of the things that the person should determine, is if the area where the search will be conducted, requires a permit. Some places require documentation, and it is advisable to get it beforehand, so there won’t be any problems when something has been found.

Treasure hunting can be fun. When following these steps, the individual will have a great time searching for an artifact and making some money from it. And most importantly, have fun.
