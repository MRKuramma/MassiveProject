## History and Development

So, before we dive in deep into metal detecting, Treasure Hunting, Treasure Spots, etc.
We first need to understand its development stages, and for what reason, it was invented. 


Let’s go back in time two centuries, and try to understand, what exactly is a **metal detector**?  
A metal detector is a tool that first came to light in the mid of the 19th century by various scientists, scholars, and gold miners, who’d all shared the same theory about a machine that could pinpoint the location of metal, buried underground. 
However, the very first metal detector mentioned in history wasn’t used to search for metal.

But, instead, it was used to try and save the 20th President of the United States, James Garfield, after he got hit by a bullet in the back, at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station, Washington D.C. on July 2, 1881, by Charles J. Guiteau. 
Although their first intention was to be used to search for metal, they have been used for medical purposes such as: extracting bullets from patients, and eventually, to be used even to detect landmines in war zones. 


The very first metal detectors were very unrefined, used a lot of battery power, and worked only to a limited degree, despite that, they were still very helpful in that period. 
Without them, the work efficiency will be greatly reduced, locating landmines would’ve been much harder, and the chances of saving a patient without using a metal detector will be lowered significantly. 
That’s why metal detectors play such an important role, both medically, militarily, and economically.

## Metal detecting as a hobby

It didn’t take long for Metal detecting to become a hobby for daily usage.
People knew they could get rich fast, if they would’ve started to use Metal Detectors on a daily basis, on the hope of finding ancient artifacts, coins, jewelry, etc.

The more they use it, the higher their chances to find artifacts is.
But, just having a metal detector, doesn’t necessarily mean it's good.
There are different types of Metal Detectors/parts.

Metal detectors for hobbyists or those who just try metal detecting for fun; has equipment that is simple and lightweight, unlike those for security purposes. This simple contraption is composed of uncomplicated parts.

1. Control panel or box – literally the area of the detector where you control almost everything.
What’s inside are the circuits. Batteries, the processor and the speakers.

2. Tube – more commonly knows as the shaft. It attaches the control panel and the search head.

3. Search head – most important part of the detector, it is the part that spots possible treasures around. (It also has other names: loop, antenna, or the search coil)

4. Stabilizer – it aids in your control when you hold the item.
This is now common for most metal detectors, but not all detectors have this feature installed.

5. Headphones – this part is also optional but advisable. It aids you in listening only to specific noises.
You can hear even the slightest sound of beeping. You can also reduce the sound around you by adding this to your machine.

There are three types of metal detectors, these are: VLF, PI and BFO. 

**VLF** or Very low frequency is the most commonly bought detector on the market. This type of machine generates an electromagnetic field and can detect at what level or depth the metal may be. 

**PI** or Pulse induction is not as common as the VLF. This contraption generates and uses the coil (just one) as the recipient and spreader of the impulses. The good thing about this item is that it can locate deep sited metals and in areas that other metal detector types have difficulty in. 

**BFO** or beat frequency oscillator is the most common and down to earth contraption there is. This type needs 2 coils that are linked and generates radio-waves. These are the cheapest available that are being sold in stores. 

Don’t forget, when you know how a detector works, you will enjoy doing it effortlessly. Research more and get the detector that you think will be the best fit for you.
